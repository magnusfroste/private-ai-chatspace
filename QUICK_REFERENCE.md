# Chatspace - Private AI - Quick Reference

## Get started in 3 steps

1. **Create Workspace** → Your workspace for a topic/project
2. **Upload documents** → Your knowledge base
3. **Chat!** → Ask questions and get answers

## Two ways to use documents

| | **RAG - Workspace documents** | **CAG - Attached files** |
|---|---|---|
| **Icon** | | |
| **What?** | Knowledge base for workspace | File directly in chat |
| **When?** | Recurring questions | One-off questions |
| **Example** | Company policies, manuals | Analyze a specific contract |

---

## How does AI search?

### Hybrid search (Recommended!)

Combines two methods automatically:

- **Keyword:** Exact words ("GDPR", "policy")
- **Semantic:** Understands meaning ("customer data" = "data protection")

**Result:** Best of both worlds!

## Advanced settings

### Do I need to change anything?

**NO!** Standard settings work for 95% of cases.

### If you want to fine-tune:

| Setting | Standard | Change if... |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Number of results** | 5 | You want faster (3) or more comprehensive (10) responses |
| **Similarity threshold** | 0.25 | You want only very relevant results (0.5) |
| **Hybrid search** | ON | Keep it on! |
| **Web search** | OFF | You need current news/real-time data |

---

## Chat modes

| Mode | Behavior | Use when... |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **Chat** (Standard) | Responds always | Conversation, brainstorming |
| **Query** | Responds only if info exists in documents | You only want answers from your documents |

---

## Quick tips

**Do:**
- Name files clearly: "HR_Policy_2024.pdf"
- Ask specific questions: "What is the termination period?"
- Combine CAG + RAG for comparing documents

**Avoid:**
- Vague questions: "Tell me everything"
- Old document versions in workspace
- Web search for all questions (waste time)

---

## Security

 Everything runs on your own servers  
 No data leaves your environment  
 Each workspace is isolated
